    "Q5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can\n",
    "you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides a wide range of functions to manipulate data in a DataFrame. Some common functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`head()` and `tail()`:** These functions allow you to view the first few or last few rows of the DataFrame, respectively.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   # View the first 5 rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "   df.head()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # View the last 3 rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "   df.tail(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`info()`:** This function provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including column names, data types, and non-null counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   # Display information about the DataFrame\n",
    "   df.info()\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`describe()`:** This function generates descriptive statistics summarizing the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the distribution of numerical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   # Generate descriptive statistics\n",
    "   df.describe()\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`dropna()`:** This function is used to remove rows or columns with missing values (NaN).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   # Remove rows with missing values\n",
    "   df.dropna(inplace=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`fillna()`:** This function is used to fill missing values with a specified value or method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   # Fill missing values with the mean of the column\n",
    "   df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`groupby()`:** This function is used to group data based on one or more columns and perform aggregate functions on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   # Group data by 'Gender' and calculate the average age for each group\n",
    "   df.groupby('Gender')['Age'].mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`sort_values()`:** This function is used to sort the DataFrame by one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   # Sort the DataFrame by 'Age' in ascending order\n",
    "   df.sort_values(by='Age', ascending=True, inplace=True)\n",
